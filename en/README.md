# &#128214;Help Viewer quick guide

<!-- @print-keep-icons -->
The application is divided into two main areas:

## Left panel

The left panel lets you navigate through the help file.

At the bottom of this panel, you‚Äôll find several buttons:

### Help navigation

  - &#x1F4D6; Hierarchical TOC (Table of Contents) tree  
    *(visible if defined by the help author)*
  - &#x1F516; Subchapter list  
    *(shown if the current chapter has subchapters)*
  - &#x1F4C7; Keywords list / Glossary  
    *(visible if defined by the help author)*
  - &#x1F50E; Fulltext keywords list  
    *(visible if defined by the help author)*

  These items are displayed as an expandable tree with clickable nodes. Clicking on an item expands its subcontent or opens the selected chapter.  
  &#x1F4C7; and &#x1F50E; have an input field at the top where you can search for an exact phrase.  
  Just start typing and press **Enter** to search.  
  Press **Esc** to clear the field.
